  ## Description
  The original concept for this app was a meetup style restaurant search application similar to Tinder. Git-Forked allows the user to login to their profile and search for restaurants, using their selected criteria. Once the user adds a restaurant to their favorites, the restaurant is saved to their 'dishboard.' This application uses the Yelp API, Express, Handlebars, passport.js, Axios, bcrypt, sequelize, and MySQL2. Future developments will include adding more Tinder-like features such as matching two people who favorited the same restaurant, or type of cuisine in the same area.
